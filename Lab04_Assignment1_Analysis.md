# Assignment 1: Image Chipping Analysis

## Issues with Sliding Window Chipping Method

### 1. **Edge Effects and Data Loss**
The sliding window chipping method has a significant disadvantage in that it can lose important information at the edges of images. When an image is divided into fixed-size chips (128x128 in our case), any pixels that don't fit into complete chips are discarded. For example, if an image is 512x512 pixels, we get 4x4 = 16 chips, but if an image were 513x513 pixels, we would still only get 4x4 chips, losing the last row and column of pixels entirely.

### 2. **No Overlap Between Chips**
The current method creates chips with no overlap, which means that features that span across chip boundaries may be artificially split. This is particularly problematic for:
- Linear features (roads, rivers, boundaries)
- Large objects that don't fit entirely within one chip
- Contextual information that extends beyond chip boundaries

### 3. **Fixed Grid Limitations**
The method uses a rigid grid system that doesn't consider the actual content or importance of different regions. Important features might be cut in half, while less important areas might be preserved intact.

### 4. **Inconsistent Coverage**
Some areas of the image may be underrepresented in the training data, especially if important features are concentrated in regions that get split across multiple chips.

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. **Overlapping Chips with Stride**
Instead of non-overlapping chips, implement a sliding window with a stride smaller than the chip size. For example:
- Chip size: 128x128
- Stride: 64x64 (50% overlap)
- This ensures better coverage and reduces edge effects

### 2. **Adaptive Chipping Based on Content**
Implement content-aware chipping that:
- Detects important features (edges, textures, objects)
- Places chip boundaries to avoid cutting through important features
- Uses variable chip sizes based on local content complexity

### 3. **Multi-Scale Chipping**
Create chips at multiple scales:
- Small chips (64x64) for fine details
- Medium chips (128x128) for moderate features  
- Large chips (256x256) for context
- This provides the model with multi-scale information

### 4. **Boundary-Aware Chipping**
Implement boundary detection algorithms to:
- Identify natural boundaries in the image
- Place chip boundaries along these natural divisions
- Ensure important features remain intact within chips

### 5. **Data Augmentation Integration**
Combine chipping with data augmentation techniques:
- Random rotation of chips
- Random cropping with overlap
- Color/contrast adjustments
- This increases dataset diversity and robustness

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Implement overlapping chips with configurable stride
2. **Phase 2**: Add content-aware boundary detection
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate multi-scale chipping
4. **Phase 4**: Combine with data augmentation techniques

This approach would significantly improve the quality and representativeness of the training data while maintaining computational efficiency.
